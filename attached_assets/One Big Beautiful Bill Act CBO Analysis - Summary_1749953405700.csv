"In keeping with reconciliation instructions from the House Committee on the Budget, this estimate reflects CBO’s January 2025 baseline projections updated to reflect enacted legislation and administrative and judicial actions. It includes budgetary effects through fiscal year 2034.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This estimate incorporates interactions among provisions within each title. (Budgetary effects of interactions among titles are shown on the “Interactions Among Titles” tab.),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because of the magnitude of its estimated budgetary effects, H.R. 1 is considered major legislation as defined in House Rule XIII(8). That rule requires cost estimates, to the extent practicable, to account for the budgetary implications of certain bills’ macroeconomic effects. CBO has not yet completed an analysis of the macroeconomic effects of H.R. 1 or their additional budgetary effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The revenues and outlays of the Social Security trust funds and the net cash flow of the Postal Service are classified as off-budget.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended, stipulates that revenue estimates provided by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) will be the official estimates for all tax legislation considered by the Congress. As such, CBO incorporates those estimates into its cost estimates of the effects of legislation. The estimates for the revenue provisions of some sections of the legislation were provided by JCT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1 would increase by 10.9 million the number of people without health insurance in 2034. That total includes an estimated 1.4 million people without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status who would no longer be covered in state-only funded programs in 2034.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1 would lower gross benchmark premiums, on average, in marketplace plans established by the Affordable Care Act by an estimated 12.2 percent in 2034. (That is, the premiums for the plans used to determine premium tax credits, but before those credits are accounted for.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
