Your latest screenshot shows improvements in card softness and subtle glow, but the **true glassmorphism—like in the design reference you provided with the Figma icon buttons—is not yet achieved**. The current cards are still pastel boxes with soft gradients and only minor shadow and transparency, missing the distinctive “through-the-glass” look. Here’s focused, actionable feedback to provide to the agent:

## **Guidance for Replit Agent: Achieving True Liquid Glass (Glassmorphism) Effect**

**Current Issue:**  
The cards do not look like glass—they don’t visibly blur the background, and they lack realistic edge highlights, strong transparency, and a sense of materiality.

**To fix this, please update the design as follows:**

---

### 1. **Implement Strong Backdrop Blur**
- Use `backdrop-filter: blur(16px) saturate(180%)` and `background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0.15)` (not a colorful pastel).
- Place the cards over a colorful, gradient, or image background so the glass blurring is clear and visually interesting.
- The content *behind* the cards must be **significantly blurred and visible through them**.

### 2. **Add High-Contrast Glass Edge**
- Apply a **solid or semi-transparent white border** (1.5–2px wide) around all cards:  
  ```css
  border: 1.5px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.45);
  ```

### 3. **Surface Reflection/Highlight**
- Add a curved or angled white reflection band at the top area of the card, using a `::before` pseudo-element, e.g.:
  ```css
  .glass-card::before {
      content: "";
      position: absolute;
      top: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
      height: 56%;
      border-radius: 2em 2em 40% 40%;
      background: linear-gradient(180deg,rgba(255,255,255,0.21) 10%,rgba(255,255,255,0.01) 100%);
      pointer-events: none;
  }
  ```

### 4. **Reduce Shadow, Boost Transparency**
- Use a softer box-shadow (not heavy purple glow) for material realism:
  ```css
  box-shadow: 0 4px 24px 0 rgba(31,38,135,0.12);
  ```

### 5. **Clean, Flat Card Content**
- Keep icons and text sharp white or black for contrast (avoid pastel text backgrounds inside the glass card).

### 6. **Button Consistency**
- Apply the same glass design to action buttons for a cohesive look.

### **Summarized Prompt for Replit Agent**

> The cards still don’t look like real glass. Please achieve the visual style shown in the provided example (the Figma glassmorphism button image) by:  
> 
> - Using a very transparent, white/clear card background with **backdrop-filter: blur(16px) saturate(180%)**;
> - Ensuring cards have a **strong white or semi-transparent border** around them;
> - Placing cards over a colorful or patterned background so the glass’s blur is clearly visible (avoid flat pale backgrounds behind glass);
> - Adding a curved, subtle white highlight (reflection band) at the card’s top using a `::before` pseudo-element;
> - Using **sharp icons/text** (white or black, not on gradient backgrounds);
> - Using only a soft shadow, not strong color glows.
> 
> Please provide the updated CSS/HTML demonstrating these changes—focus on actual glass-like transparency and blurring, as shown in the Figma button glassmorphism reference.
