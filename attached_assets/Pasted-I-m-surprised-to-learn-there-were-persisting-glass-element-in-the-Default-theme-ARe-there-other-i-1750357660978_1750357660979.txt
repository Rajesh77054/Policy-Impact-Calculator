I'm surprised to learn there were persisting glass element in the 'Default' theme. ARe there other instances of glass element in the Default theme pages?

Based on my analysis of your CSS files, yes, there are still several instances where glass elements persist in the Default theme, despite your extensive override attempts.

Current Glass Element Issues in Default Theme
1. Broad Glass Class Overrides Are Incomplete
Your default-theme.css targets many glass classes but misses some:

.glass-refractive-border and .glass-edge-glow from glassmorphism-consolidated.css
.glass-morphism variations
Some Apple glass variants like .apple-glass-adaptive
2. Portal Content Still Has Glass Effects
Even with your extensive portal targeting, some Radix UI components may still inherit glassmorphism because:

Portal elements render outside the theme context
Some components use dynamic class application
CSS specificity battles between your overrides and the glass styles
3. Dynamic Glass Application
Looking at your index.css, there are still some broad glass rules that could affect Default theme:

The .liquid-glass-theme selectors are well-scoped, but some utility classes might bleed through
Background gradient utilities that might still apply glass effects
4. Component-Level Glass Persistence
Your results dashboard and other components might still be applying glass classes programmatically through:

Conditional className applications
Dynamic theme switching logic
Component props that add glass classes
Key Areas to Investigate
In Results Dashboard:

Check if any components are still using glass-card, glass-droplet, or similar classes
Look for dynamic className logic that might apply glass effects
In Form Components:

Select dropdowns, tooltips, and popovers are the most likely culprits
These often render in portals outside your theme context
In Navigation/Header:

Theme selector button and navigation elements
Any dropdown menus or tooltips
Root Cause Analysis
The main issue is that CSS specificity and portal rendering create scenarios where your Default theme overrides don't reach all elements. Glass effects can persist through:

Portal Rendering: Components rendered outside the theme wrapper
Higher Specificity: Some glassmorphism rules have higher specificity
Dynamic Class Application: JavaScript adding glass classes after CSS loads
Inheritance Gaps: Some nested elements not covered by your overrides
The solution would require a more surgical approach - targeting the specific components and ensuring all glass-related classes are completely nullified with maximum CSS specificity for the Default theme context.
