Looking at your codebase, I can identify why the industry dropdown still has a transparent background. The issue is in your CSS import structure and specificity conflicts.

Root Cause Analysis
In your index.css, you're importing files in this order:

@import './default-theme.css';
@import './glassmorphism-consolidated.css';
However, glassmorphism-consolidated.css contains several rules that are not properly scoped to .liquid-glass-theme, which means they're applying globally and overriding your default theme styles.

Specific Problems in glassmorphism-consolidated.css
Global Background Overrides (lines near the bottom):
.liquid-glass-theme [class*="bg-"]:not([role="tooltip"]):not([data-radix-popper-content-wrapper]):not([data-radix-dropdown-content]):not([data-radix-select-content]):not([data-radix-context-menu-content]):not([data-radix-hover-card-content]):not([data-radix-navigation-menu-viewport]):not(.bg-popover) {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.01) !important;
  background-image: none !important;
}
This rule is supposed to be scoped to .liquid-glass-theme but the selector structure makes it apply to elements that have background classes even outside the liquid glass theme.

Pseudo-element Hiding:
.liquid-glass-theme *::before,
.liquid-glass-theme *::after {
  display: none !important;
}
This is too broad and might be affecting dropdown styling.

The Industry Dropdown Issue
The industry dropdown (likely a Radix Select component) is getting affected because:

The CSS selector .liquid-glass-theme [class*="bg-"] is matching elements outside of the .liquid-glass-theme context due to CSS specificity rules
The !important declarations are overriding the solid background styles from default-theme.css
Even though default-theme.css is imported first, the glassmorphism rules have higher specificity
Solutions Needed
The glassmorphism rules need to be more precisely scoped. The current selectors like .liquid-glass-theme [class*="bg-"] can match elements in the default theme if there's any CSS cascade inheritance happening.

You should either:

Restructure the CSS imports to load glassmorphism after default theme with more specific scoping
Fix the overly broad selectors in glassmorphism-consolidated.css
Add more specific default theme overrides for the dropdown components
The core issue is that glassmorphism effects are "bleeding" into the default theme through CSS specificity conflicts, despite being intended to be theme-scoped.
