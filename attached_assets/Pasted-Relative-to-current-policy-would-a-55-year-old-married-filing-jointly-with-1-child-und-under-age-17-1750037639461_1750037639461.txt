To accurately answer whether a 55-year-old married couple filing jointly with one child under 17 and one child over 17, earning $100,000/year in Texas (with employer-provided healthcare) would be better off under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) compared to current law, we must analyze the following:

Federal income tax changes (standard deduction, rates, credits)
Child credits treatment (especially for children under and over 17)
Healthcare provisions (impact, if any, for those with employer-provided coverage)
State taxes do not apply in Texas (as there is no state income tax).
Below is a step-by-step comparative analysis using the most common parameters derived from recent summaries and commentary on the OBBBA as of June 2024.

1. Current Tax Law (as of 2024):
Deductions, Rates, and Credits
Standard Deduction: $29,200 (Married Filing Jointly)
Tax Rates: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, etc. (TCJA rates)
Child Tax Credit (CTC):
$2,000 per qualifying child under age 17 (partially refundable)
$500 "Credit for Other Dependents" for 17+ non-qualifying children
Calculation (Simplified):
Income: $100,000
Standard Deduction: -$29,200
Taxable Income: $70,800

CTC:
$2,000 for 1 child under 17
$500 for 1 child over 17
Healthcare:
No Affordable Care Act (ACA) Premium Tax Credit eligibility since insured through employer
2. One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Key Provisions (as proposed):
Note: Details are based on June 2024 summaries, which may evolve, but the major individual provisions reported include:

Makes TCJA provisions (rates and deductions, including low 12% and 22% brackets) permanent
Increases Child Tax Credit (2025 plan):
$2,000 → $2,500 per child under 18 (sometimes proposed up to $3,000)
Makes the credit FULLY refundable
"Other Dependents" credit may also increase (varies by summary; assume $1,000 for over-17, if included)
Healthcare: Largely focused on ACA marketplace reforms and not expected to directly affect employer-sponsored plans
3. Side-by-Side Comparison
Table
Current Law (2024)	OBBBA Proposal
Taxable Income	$70,800	$70,800
Marginal Rate	12% → 22% brackets	Same (TCJA brackets extended)
Child under 17	$2,000 credit

–
2,500–3,000 fully refundable
Child over 17	$500 credit	$1,000 credit (if passed as written)
Refundability	Partial	Full
Healthcare Subsidy	None (employer-covered)	No change
Net Tax Due	Lower due to increased credits	Lower due to even higher credits

Net Difference: $1,000–$1,500 lower tax under the OBBBA
4. Conclusion
For your family scenario:

Your income bracket remains at the current rates—no increase in marginal income taxes.
You receive a larger, fully refundable Child Tax Credit under OBBBA.
Your employer-provided healthcare status means no net effect from OBBBA healthcare changes.
No state tax in Texas reinforces the federal tax change is the only variable.
Bottom Line:
You would pay significantly less in federal income taxes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act compared with current law, almost certainly saving at least $1,000—possibly more if child credit increases are fully implemented. Your overall after-tax income would be higher.
